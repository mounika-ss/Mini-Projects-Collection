## Supabase is like PostgreSQL on the cloud.
- Supabase, which is like an online notebook for databases.
- It gives you a Postgres database (like a very powerful cupboard).
- You just log in to a website → it gives you a database to use.
- You don’t need to install heavy stuff, just log in and click buttons.
